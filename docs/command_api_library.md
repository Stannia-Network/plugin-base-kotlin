# Command API Library
We've taken the Command API System from our plugin API library and provided it in this plugin base project. Reason is simply because almost all plugins has commands, and the default command system is inconvenient.

## Usage
We have various command type classes, each one that can be extended. We've also provided a few example commands for you to look at.
